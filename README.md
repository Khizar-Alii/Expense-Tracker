Introducing my new React App Expense Tracker - this app helps in managing your finances effortlessly!, one can easily track the income and expenses, and get a clear understanding of your financial standing.
The app's primary function is to track your income and expenses. Users can enter the amount, description, and category (income or expense) of each transaction. The app then automatically calculates the total amount and presents it in an easy-to-read format. Furthermore, the app provides a detailed list of all transactions below the total, giving you a clear overview of your financial activity.
The app comprises three primary functional-based components. The Home component is the main component, which includes two additional components, the Overview and Transaction components.
In this app I used various hooks, such as useState and useEffect, to manage data and state efficiently. Additionally, I used Style Components to give the app a modern and visually appealing interface.

Also add the search functionality. Users can search for specific transactions by keyword or filter them by category, making it easier to track expenses or income over a given period.In summary, the Expense Tracker app is an intuitive and practical solution for managing your finances. With its three primary functional-based components, various hooks, and style components, this app offers a smooth and efficient user experience.
